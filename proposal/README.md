# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Yale Fitness

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to make a fitness tracking app that creates a nutritional plan for users who wish to gain or lose weight. The web application will take into account the user's daily activies in addition to weight goals.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Right now, I plan on making 4 pages: a homepage, a goals page, a progress page, and a login page.
The homepage will display the users goals and a short summary of the users daily guidelines. Next, the goals page will be where the user
can set their goals and when they submit their goals they will be taken back to the homepage where their goals are. Finally, the progress
page will contain a chart that displays the users progress towards their goals. The webpage will calculate a dietary plan for each of the
following groups: calories, carbs, protein, and fat.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A page that calculates goals for protein, carbs, fat, and calories.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I can create a self-updating chart for the user's progress.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A page that creates a 100 percent personal plan for each user and allows them to input all of their excercises and their body types in order to get
a dynamic dietary tracker.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to research nutritional guidelines in order to make accurate calculations. I will also need to learn how to create charts on a webpage that updates every time the user inputs new data. Obviously there is more for me to learn, but I will probably realize this along the way.
