# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I think I might try to make a nutrition tracker application on the internet. This would track the caloric intake of the user as well as the macronutrient totals
every day. I will also try to make the website calculate reasonable goals for the user based on their nutritional goals. I want to make my app different than many
of the common fitness tracker apps by making it take into account not just the weight that the user wants to gain/lose, but their desire for muscle gain vs fat
loss or general fitness and health.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I plan to work on my own

## Do you have any questions of your own?
