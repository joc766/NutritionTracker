HOW TO USE YALEFITNESS:

1. First, all users should register for an account. Account emails/usernames must be yale emails ending in @yale.edu. Passwords can be in any structure.

2. Users can use the log in button in future to log in to their accounts now that they are registered.

3. All pages on the webpage can be accessed via the navbar at the top of the page.

4. Next, the user will be taken to the homepage, but at first, the webpage will be blank and will direct the user to the Set Goals page so that the
user can set their goals. On this page, users must input their sex (must be male or female because I intentionally didn't choose to put gender here because gender
orientation does not affect the users dietary needs the way biological sex does), their age in years, their height in inches (ex. a 6 foot tall person would input 72), their weight
in lbs, their goalweight in lbs, and their activity level. "Extremely Active" users do hard physical excercise at least every day for excercise, sports, or
physical jobs. "Very Active" users excercise 6 to 7 times a week. "Moderately Active" users excercise 3 to 5 times a week. "Lightly Active" users excercise 1 to
3 times a week. "Sedentary" users do little to no excercise on a weekly basis.

5. Users can view their calculated daily nutritional needs below the form where they input their goals.

6. It is important to note that when users input their weekly activity levels, they should not add these routine excercises to the Daily Excercise page because
these calories have already been accounted for in the users daily calorie allowance.

7. To add extra excercises beyond the normal activity level for the user, go to the Daily Excercise Page. Select an excercise and the number of hours spent
excercising.

8. Users should input all of the food that they eat each day into the Food Tracker page by entering the name of the food and its nutritional information
(calories, carbohydrates (g), protein (g), and fats (g)).

9. All of the users information for each day can be found on the homepage. There is a graph to the left that displays the user's daily intake of macronutrients
alongside their goal macronutrients for each day. To the right, a pie chart shows the user's daily caloric intake out of their daily goal for calories. If the
user exceeds their recommended daily intake of calories, a message will display how many calories they have exceeded their recommended amount by. On both of
the charts, users can hover their cursor over each column or pie slice to show the exact value that each one has.

10. Every day, the tables on the homepage will reset and the user should continue to input their nutritional progress every day.

11. Once the user has put in at least 3 different foods, there will be a section of the homepage that allows users to quickly input their "favorite" or most
frequently input foods by simply selecting that food and pressing submit.

12. Users can also update their goals and their current weights on the Set Goals Page by reinputting the same information as before with updates for the necessary
categories.

13. To log out, users can click the "Log Out" button at the top right corner.
